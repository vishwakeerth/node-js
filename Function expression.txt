Function expression:

Function Expression  allows us to create an anonymous function which doesnâ€™t have any function name which is the main difference between Function Expression and Function Declaration
A function expression can be used as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)which runs as soon as it is defined. A function expression has to be stored in a variable and can be accessed using variableName


1.Syntax for Function Declaration: 

function functionName(x, y) { statements... return (z) };

2.Syntax for Function Expression (named) :  

let variableName = function functionName(x, y) 
{ statements... return (z) };

3.Syntax for Arrow Function: 

let variableName = (x, y) => { statements... return (z) }; 



Example 1: Code for Function Declaration

<script>
	function callAdd(x, y){
		let z = x + y;
		return z;
	}
	console.log("Addition : " + callAdd(7, 4));
</script>
