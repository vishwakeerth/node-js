Node.js Stream readable.pipe() Method

The readable.pipe() method in a Readable Stream is used to attach a Writable stream to the readable stream so that it consequently switches into flowing mode and then pushes all the data that it has to the attached Writable. 

Syntax: readable.pipe( destination, options )

Parameters: This method accept two parameters as mentioned above and described below:

destination:   This parameter holds the destination of writing data.
options:       This parameter holds the pipe options.
Return Value:  It returns the stream.Writable destination, 
               allowing for a chain of pipes if it is a Duplex or a Transform stream. 

Example:
var fs = require("fs");
 
// Create a readable stream
var readable = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
 
// Create a writable stream
var writable = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');
 
// Calling pipe method
readable.pipe(writable);
 
console.log("Program Ended");
