 	Node.js Timer functions are global functions. 
You don't need to use require() function in order to use timer functions. 
Let's see the list of timer functions.

Set timer functions:-

setImmediate():-> It is used to execute setImmediate.
setInterval() :-> It is used to define a time interval.
setTimeout()  :-> It is used to execute a one-time callback after delay milliseconds.

Clear timer functions:

  -> It is used to stop an immediateObject, as created by setImmediate

clearInterval(intervalObject)  : 
  ->It is used to stop an intervalObject, as created by setInterval

clearTimeout(timeoutObject)    : 
 ->It prevents a timeoutObject, as created by setTimeout
