Notes on Streams and Buffer

-Buffer:A temporary space for chunk of data that is being transferred from one place to another,

Its filled with dataand then pass along, It transfers small amount of data at a time.

-Stream: used to create the streams in node js to transfer data,

And it increase performance.

Types of Streams:

In Node, there are four different types of streams:

Readable streams → To create a stream of data for reading (say, reading a large file in chunks).
Writable streams → To create a stream of data for writing (say, writing a large amount of data to a file).
Duplex streams → To create a stream that is both readable and writable at the same time. 
Transform streams → To create a stream that is readable and writable, but the data can be modified while reading and writing to the stream.
