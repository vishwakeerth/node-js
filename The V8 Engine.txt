The V8 Engine :

V8 is the name of the JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome. 
It's the thing that takes our JavaScript and executes it while browsing with Chrome. 
V8 is the JavaScript engine i.e. it parses and executes JavaScript code.
The cool thing is that the JavaScript engine is independent of the browser in which it's hosted. 
This key feature enabled the rise of Node.js. V8 was chosen to be the engine that powered Node.js back in 2009, and as the popularity of Node.js exploded. 
V8 became the engine that now powers an incredible amount of server-side code written in JavaScript
