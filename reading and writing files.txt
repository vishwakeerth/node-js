fs.rmdir() is an asynchronous function. This function accepts three params:

path (<string>|<Buffer>|<URL>): 

The folder name and its path which is to be deleted.
options (<Object>)
maxRetries<integer>: It is an integer value, used to specified the number of times the program will try to delete the directory if the operation fails with a specified retryDelay milliseconds interval. This option is ignored if the recursive option is false. Default value is 0.
recursive<boolean>: If recursive is defined as true, the program will perform a recursive directory removal. In specified true, errors will not be reported if the directory path does not exist. Default is false.
retryDelay <integer>: This declares the time in milliseconds to wait between retries. This option is ignored when recursive is false. Default is 100 milliseconds.
callback <function>: callback function declaration, can be used to catch any possible errors or exceptions.

Example : 

const fs = require('fs');


// directory path
const dir = 'temp';


// delete directory recursively
try {
fs.rmdirSync(dir, { recursive: true });


console.log(`${dir} is deleted!`);
} catch (err) {
console.error(`Error while deleting ${dir}.`);
}
